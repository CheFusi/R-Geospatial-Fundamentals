# Spatial Queries

Spatial analysis is a process that begins with exploring and mapping a
dataset and can lead to potentially complex models and visualizations of
real world features and phenomena. `Spatial queries` are the building
blocks of this analytical process. These queries are software operations
that allow us to ask questions of our data and which return data
metrics, subsets or new data objects. In this lesson we explore the two
basic types of spatial queries: measurement queries and relationship
queries.

-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Types of Spatial Queries

The basic types of **spatial queries** are:

-   <u>Spatial Measurement Queries</u>
    -   What is feature A's **length**?
        -   *What is the length of the BART train line between Walnut
            Creek and Rockridge?*
    -   What is feature A's **area**?
        -   *What is the area of Alameda County?*
    -   What is feature A's **distance** from feature B?
        -   *What is the distance between Berkeley High School and
            Berkeley BART Station?*
    -   etc.
-   <u>Spatial Relationship Queries</u>
    -   Is feature A **within** feature B?
        -   *What schools are in Berkeley?*
    -   Does feature A **intersect** with feature B?
        -   \*What in what cities is Tilden Regional Park located?
    -   Does feature A **cross** feature B?
        -   *Does the BART line cross into Albany?*
    -   etc.
-   <u>Combination Spatial Queries</u>
    -   *What schools in Berkeley are within 1/4 mile of a BART
        station?*

Both measurement and relationship queries operate on the geometry of
features in one or in two datasets and are dependent on the type of
geometry. For example, with `point` features you can make distance
measurements or ask what points are spatially inside polygon objects.
But it would not make sense to compute the area of a point. Polygon
features, on the other hand, allow for a wider range of both measurement
and spatial relationship queries.

There are important distinctions between these two types of queries. -
Measurement queries **always depend** on the CRS of the data while
spatial relationship queries almost always do not. - Measurement queries
return a continuous value (e.g. area) while relationship queries
evaluate to true or false, and then return the features for which the
relationship is true.

### Spatial Queries are Special

We already know how to do attribute queries with our data. For example,
we can select one or more specific counties by name or select those
counties where the total population is greater than 100,000 because we
have these columns in the dataset.

Spatial queries are special because they are dynamic. For example, we
can compute area from the geometry without it already being encoded or
we can select BART stations in Berkeley even if city is not encoded in
the BART data by linking those two spatial datasets in the same
geographic space. This dynamic query capability is extremely powerful!

In this lesson we'll work through examples of each of those types of
queries.

## Load and prep the data

Load the libraries we will use.

```{r, message=F}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(here)

```

Read in the CA Counties data and then take a look at its geometry and
attributes.

```{r}
# Read in the counties shapefile
counties = st_read(dsn = here("data", 
                              "california_counties", 
                              "CaliforniaCounties.shp"))

counties <- st_make_valid(counties)

plot(counties$geometry)
```

Take a look at the spatial dataframe.

```{r}
head(counties,2)
```

#### What is the CRS of the Counties data?

-   What are the units of that CRS?

#### Select just `Alameda County` and save it to a spatial dataframe

```{r}
alameda = counties[counties$NAME=='Alameda',]
plot(alameda$geometry)
```

## Measurement Queries

### Units

We'll start off with some simple measurement queries.

We can get the area of Alameda County with the`sf` function `st_area`.

```{r}
st_area(alameda)
```

Okay! We got the area of the county in square meters.

> `sf` uses the `units` package to manage (get and set) units.

It's more useful to return the area of large regions in square KM (or sq
miles) and we can do that with set_units

So let's try that conversion with `units`.

```{r}
units::set_units(st_area(alameda), km^2)
```

#### Now you try it! Calculate the area of Alameda County in sq miles.

-   What should you change `km^2` to?
-   Hint: you can take a look at [Measurement units in
    R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/units/vignettes/measurement_units_in_R.html)

```{r}
units::set_units(st_area(alameda), mi^2)  ## WHAT SHOULD YOU CHANGE IT TO?
```

#### Always check your measurements

It's a good idea to check one or two measurements before you automate
your workflow to make sure you are getting valid values. If we look up
the area of Alameda county on wikipedia we get `739 sq mi (1,910 km2)`.
Are the values returned by `st_area` valid? Why might they differ?

### Calculate Area for the Counties

We can also use `st_area` to add the area of all counties to the spatial
dataframe.

```{r}
counties$areakm2 <- units::set_units(st_area(counties), km^2)

# take a look
head(counties)
```

### CRS and Spatial Measurements

Spatial measurements can differ greatly depending on the CRS. Let's take
a look.

```{r}
# Calculate area using data in WGS84 CRS (4326)
counties$areakm2_wgs84 <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties,4326)), km^2)

# Calculate area using data in UTM NAD83 zone 10 CRS (26910)
counties$areakm2_utm <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties,26910)), km^2)

# Calculate area using data in Web Mercator CRS (3857)
counties$areakm2_web <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties, 3857)), km^2)

# Take a look at a subset of columns only
head(counties[,c('NAME','areakm2','areakm2_wgs84','areakm2_utm','areakm2_web')])

```

**Output Interpretation:**

-   **CA Albers:** The source data's CRS, CA Albers, is optimized for
    accurate area measurements within California. Values in the
    **`area_km2`** column are highly precise, assuming accurate
    underlying geometry.

-   **WGS84:** Computing areas in WGS84 (a geographic CRS with decimal
    degrees) yields almost identical values. Modern versions of the
    **`sf`** package use spherical geometry for precise area
    computations, even in geographic data.

-   **UTM10:** This CRS is optimized for Northern California, making it
    less accurate as you move away from the zone's center (e.g.,
    Southern California).

-   **Web Mercator:** While preserving shape, Web Mercator significantly
    distorts area. It's unsuitable for precise area calculations.

Check out the help documentation for `?st_area` for more information.
The important takeaway is that you need to use a CRS that is appropriate
for your analysis/mapping needs!

When creating a spatial analysis work flow it is common to start by
transforming all of your data to the same, appropriate CRS.

### Calculating Length with `st_length`

We can use the `st_length` operator in the same way to calculate the
length features in a spatial dataframe. Always take note of the output
units!

How many miles of bike blvd in Alameda

```{r}

 #note the different file type
bart_lines <- st_read(here('data', 'transportation', 'bart_lines_2019.geojson'))

#data: https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/catalog/stanford-mh686mh0418

plot(bart_lines$geometry)
```

```{r}
bart_lines$len_mi <- units::set_units(st_length(bart_lines), mi)
bart_lines$len_km <- units::set_units(st_length(bart_lines), km)
bart_lines$len_m <- units::set_units(st_length(bart_lines), m)

bart_lines$len_m <- units::set_units(st_length(bart_lines), m)


bart_lines$len_NAD83 <- units::set_units(st_length(st_transform(bart_lines,26910)), m)
bart_lines$len_WebMarc <- units::set_units(st_length(st_transform(bart_lines,3857)), m)
bart_lines$len_WGS84 <- units::set_units(st_length(st_transform(bart_lines,4326)), m)

head(bart_lines)
```

### Calculating Distance

The `st_distance` function can be used to find the distance between two
geometries or two sets of geometries.

Compute the distance between two schools...

```{r}
schools_sf = st_read(dsn =here("data",
                               "California_Schools_2019-20",
                               "SchoolSites1920.shp"))
```

```{r}

schools_sf$Site
st_distance(schools_sf[schools_sf$SchoolName=='Alameda High',], 
                          schools_sf[schools_sf$SchoolName=='Berkeley High',])
```

You can also use it to find the distance between multiple features.

```{r}

#match CRS'
schools_utm10 <- st_transform(schools_sf, 26910)

bart_lines_utm10 = st_transform(bart_lines, st_crs(schools_utm10 ))
```

```{r}
st_distance(schools_utm10[schools_utm10$SchoolName=='Berkeley High',], bart_lines_utm10)
#distance between school and each portion of bike blv
```

### Calculating Nearest Feature

You can use `st_distance` and its companion function
`st_nearest_feature` to compute the distance between each feature and
the **nearest** bike boulevard. The `st_nearest_feature` function
returns the ID of the closest feature.

-   update for school to nearest bart station

```{r}

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

-   need to decide if this method of filtering is too advanced for this
    lesson - can stick to \$

```{r}

Berkeley_schools_utm10 <- schools_utm10 %>% filter(DistrictNa=="Berkeley Unified")

Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10 <- Berkeley_schools_utm10 %>% filter(SchoolType=="Elementary")
Berkeley_Middle_schools_utm10 <- Berkeley_schools_utm10 %>% filter(SchoolType=="Middle")
```

```{r}
# Identify the nearest bike boulevard for each school
nearest_elementary_middle_school = st_nearest_feature(Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10 , Berkeley_Middle_schools_utm10)

# take a look!
nearest_elementary_middle_school
```

To repeat, the `st_nearest_feature` function returns the ID of the
closest feature. These are stored in `nearest_elementary_middle_school`.

Then we can calculate the distance between each school and it's nearest
bike boulevard.

```{r}
Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10$elementary_middle_school_dist <- st_distance(Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10, Berkeley_Middle_schools_utm10[nearest_elementary_middle_school,], 
                                              by_element = TRUE)

#take alook


Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10[, c("SchoolName","elementary_middle_school_dist")]
                                  
# can order 
#Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10[order(Berkeley_Elementary_schools_utm10$elementary_middle_school_dist),]

```

## Manipulation Queries

Summary ...

There is no need to memorize these spatial operators (aka predicates)!
[Here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf) is a
fantastic `sf` cheatsheet that lists and briefly explains all these
common functions (and many more).

### Geometric Confirmations - Spatial Relationship Queries

[Spatial relationship
queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_relation) consider how
two geometries or sets of geometries relate to one another in space. For
example, you may want to know what schools are located within the City
of Berkeley or what East Bay Regional Parks have land within Berkeley.
You may also want to combine a measurement query with a spatial
relationship query. Example, you may want to know the total length of
freeways within the city of Berkeley.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png){height="300px"}

-   st_intersects
-   st_within
-   st_contains (the inverse of st_within)
-   st_disjoint

These can be used to select features in one dataset based on their
spatial relationship to another. In other words, you can use these
operations to make spatial selections or create spatial subsets.

### How Many Special Education Schools in ... (st_intersects)

#### What does `spatially intersects` mean?

Here's one way to explain it.

> Geometry A spatially intersects Geometry B if any of its parts (e.g.,
> a point, line segment, or polygon) is equivalent to, touches, crosses,
> is contained by, contains, or overlaps any part of Geometry B.

So `st_intersects` is the most general of all spatial relationships! It
is also the most useful. However, you can specify any of those more
specific spatial relationships by setting `op=` to any of the options
listed in the `?st_intersects?` help documentation.

First, load the `CA Places` data and select the city of Berkeley and
save it to a sf dataframe.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
counties_utm10 = st_transform(counties, st_crs(schools_utm10 ))
```

```{r}
Alameda_county_utm10 <- counties_utm10 %>% filter(NAME=="Alameda")
```

```{r}
Continuation_schools_utm10 <- schools_utm10 %>% filter(SchoolType=="Continuation")

#more info on Continuation schools: https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/eo/ce/
```

If you look at the Schools data you will see that it has a `City`
column. So we can subset the data by attribute to select the Schools in
Berkeley. No need to do a spatial selection. But let's do it anyway to
demonstrate the process.

Assume that the schools data do not have that city column. *How can we
identify the schools in Berkeley spatially?*

Here's how!

```{r}
# SPATIALLY select only the schools within Berkeley

#op = operation
Continuation_Alameda_utm10 <- Continuation_schools_utm10[Alameda_county_utm10, ,op=st_intersects]


```

**Yes that was it! Take a long look at that simple yet powerful spatial
selection syntax.**

You should interpret that syntax as:

-   Select the features (i.e. rows) in the `schools_utm10` dataframe

-   whose geometry **spatially intersects** the `Berkeley_utm10`
    geometry

-   and keep all of the `schools_utm10` columns

    -   *all because the extraction brackets have no second argument*

##### Important

The **op=st_intersects** argument is optional because `st_intersects` is
the default spatial selector.

To emphasize this, let's rerun the last command.

```{r}
# SPATIALLY select only the special education schools within Alameda county

Continuation_Alameda_utm10 <- Continuation_schools_utm10[Alameda_county_utm10, ]
```

Let's check out the `sf` object that our selection returned.

```{r}
# Map the results
plot(Alameda_county_utm10$geometry)
plot(Continuation_Alameda_utm10$geometry, col="red", add = T)
```

> **IMPORTANT**: The default spatial selection operator is
> `st_intersects`. If you want to use any other spatial operator - *and
> it is rare that you need to* - it must be specified.

For example, we can use the `st_disjoint` operator to select only those
schools **NOT** in Berkeley.

```{r}
# Select all Alameda County Schools NOT in Berkeley with the disjoint operator
Continuation_Alameda_utm10_disjoint <- Continuation_schools_utm10[Alameda_county_utm10, ,op=st_disjoint]

# Plot the result
# fix : use tmap, add CA boundary 
plot(Continuation_Alameda_utm10_disjoint$geometry)
plot(Alameda_county_utm10, 
     col = NA, 
     border = "red", 
     add = T)
```

st_intersects or st_intersection?

It really depends! But make sure you understand the difference.

`st_intersects` is a logical operator that returns `true` if two
geometries intersect in any way. When used to subset (or filter) a
spatial dataframe, `st_intersects` returns those features in a dataframe
that intersect with the filter dataframe.

On the other hand, `st_intersection` returns a new spatial dataframe
that is the set intersection of the two dataframes, including both the
geometries and attributes of the intersecting features. Use
`st_intersection` with caution and always check your results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Geometric Operations - Proximity Analyses

-   st_buffer
-   st_centroid

## Proximity Analysis

Now that we've seen the basic idea of spatial measurement and spatial
relationship queries, let's take a look at a common analysis that
combines those concepts: **promximity analysis**.

Proximity analysis seeks to identify **near** features - or, in other
words, all features in a focal feature set that are within some maximum
distance of features in a reference feature set.

A very common workflow for this analysis is:

1.  Buffer around the features in the reference dataset to create buffer
    polygons.

2.  Run a spatial relationship query to find all focal features that
    intersect (or are within) the buffer polygons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's read in our bike boulevard data again.

Then we'll find out which of our Berkeley schools are within a block's
distance (200 meters) of the bike boulevards.

```{r}
#bart_lines <- st_read(here("data",
                           #"transportation",
                           #"BerkeleyBikeBlvds.geojson"))
plot(bart_lines$geometry)
```

Of course, we need to reproject the boulevards to our projected CRS.

```{r}
bart_lines_utm10 = st_transform(bart_lines, st_crs(Alameda_county_utm10))
```

Now we can create our 800 meter buffers.

```{r}
bart_lines_buf_utm10 = st_buffer(bart_lines_utm10, dist = 800)

#5-10 minute walk = ~ 4-800 m

#more info on walkablw cities: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667091722000188
```

Now let's overlay everything.

```{r}
tm_shape(Alameda_county_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'lightgrey') + 
tm_shape(bart_lines_buf_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'pink', alpha = 0.5) +
tm_shape(bart_lines_utm10) + 
  tm_lines() + 
tm_shape(Continuation_Alameda_utm10) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', size = 0.2)

#plotting bike blvd 200m buffer and all schools within Alameda
```

Great! Looks like we're all ready to run our spatial relationship query
to complete the proximity analysis. At this point (pun intended) select
the schools that are in within the bike boulevard buffer polygons.

```{r}

Continuation_Alameda_utm10_bart_buf <- Continuation_schools_utm10[bart_lines_buf_utm10, ,op=st_intersects]

```

Now let's overlay again, to see if the schools we selected make sense.

```{r}

#redo this with GGPLOT so you just add the yellow 

tm_shape(Alameda_county_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'lightgrey') + 
  
# add the bike blvd buffer polygons  
tm_shape(bart_lines_buf_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'pink', alpha = 0.5) +

# add the bike blvd line features  
tm_shape(bart_lines_utm10) + 
  tm_lines() + 

# add all berkeley schools  
tm_shape(Continuation_Alameda_utm10) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', size = 0.2)+

# add schools near bike boulevards in yellow
tm_shape(Continuation_Alameda_utm10_bart_buf) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'yellow', size = 0.2) #which berkeley schools are within 200m of bike boulevard
```

## Geomtric Operations: Point Maps

Choropleth maps are great, but point maps enable us to visualize our
spatial data in another way.

If you know both mapping methods you can expand how much information you
can show in one map.

For example, point maps are a better way to map `counts` because the
varying sizes of areas are deemphasized.

-   We can use the `sf::st_centroid` function to dynamically transform
    the county polygons to their centroids (point centers).

-   We then use the `tm_dot` element to create point maps dynamically
    from polygon data! Let's take a look.

```{r}
# County population counts as a point map!
tmap_mode('plot')

# Add the county polygon borders as a basemap
tm_shape(counties) + 
  tm_borders(col = "grey") +
  
# Then map the county centroids as points colored by population counts
  tm_shape(st_centroid(counties)) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'POP2012',
              palette = 'YlOrRd', 
              style = 'jenks',
              border.col = "black",  # dot borders only visible in interactive mode!
              border.lwd = 1,
              border.alpha = 1,
              size = .5,
              legend.show = T) 
```

This is another useful type of data transformation for making effective
maps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Geometric Creations

-   st_point
-   st_voronoi (?)

### Making your own sf objects

You can hand code your own sf objects, but most people just read in
spatial data from a file!

```{r, eval=T}
p <- rbind(c(10, 40), c(40, 30), c(20, 20), c(30, 10))
(mp <- st_multipoint(p))
plot(mp)

```

```{r}

```
