## Learning Objectives

We will work to

**2.1 Understand the content of spatial dataframes and the different geometry types**

-   Why: An understanding of the structure of spatial dataframes allows for accurate manipulation and analysis, while recognizing different geometry types allows for nuanced representation of various geographic features.

**2.2 Create thematic maps and understand the information depicted**

-   Thematic maps visually communicate spatial patterns, enabling intuitive interpretation and comparison of spatial patterns and data distributions.

**2.3 Navigate different coordinate reference systems (CRS)**

-   CRS knowledge, including encoding, transformation, and selection, ensures accurate integration of spatial data from various sources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview

Some of the questions we hope to answer are

1.  Spatial data structure

    -   What defines a spatial dataframe

    -   Which base R dataframe functions are applicable to spatial dataframes

2.  Basic Plotting

    -   what is the difference between plotting data of, for example, an XY plot versus mapping said data

3.  Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

    -   What are different ways to transform earths shape and size to best suit our analysis

dim
str 
class #r dataframe and sf object with additional meta data

#TRANSITION: #other subsetting and use a subsetted portion to go into plotting 
#explain why the geometry column is stick (stays when dataframe is subsetted)

st_as_sf #(?)
```

Question or challenge: could be around developing an X Y plot of the same data that we plot in section 5: and this is what is used to get at the essential question of what additional insight a spatial dimension gives

# **2.3 Coordinate Reference Systems**

[**Objective: Navigate different coordinate reference systems (CRS)**]{.underline}

*Intro to section*

-   Define a CRS

-   Why are CRS' important

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A. Geographic vs. projected CRS

*Summary on the main types of coordinate reference systems (CRS)*

-   ...

-   ... (example below)

![](https://www.earthdatascience.org/images/earth-analytics/spatial-data/spatial-projection-transformations-crs.png)

##### Geographic CRSs

-   `4326: WGS84` (units decimal degrees) - the most commonly used geographic CRS

-   `4269: NAD83` (units decimal degrees) - a geographic CRS customized to best fit the USA. This is used by most geographic data produced by US federal agencies including the Census.

    -   `NAD83 (epsg:4269)` and `WGS84(epsg:4326)` geographic data can be considered equivalent although locations can differ by up to 1 meter in the continental USA and elsewhere up to 3m. That is not a big issue with census tract data as these data are only accurate within +/-7meters.

##### Projected CRSs

-   `5070: USA CONUS NAD83` (units meters) projected CRS for mapping the entire contiguous USA (CONUS)

-   `3857: Web Mercator` (units meters) conformal (shape preserving) CRS used as the default in web mapping

-   `3310: CA Albers Equal Area, NAD83` (units meters) projected CRS for CA statewide mapping and spatial analysis

-   `102641 to 102646: CA State Plane zones 1-6, NAD83` (units feet) projected CRS used for local analysis.
